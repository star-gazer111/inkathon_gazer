The workshop which inspired was by Scio-Labs : Encode x Polkadot Hackathon: Launch Event + Start building dApps on ink! workshop

The above workshop inspired me to make a Buidling Status inputting and fetching system. The video involved the greeting inputing and fetching. I changed the inputting system to the status of the user which can be either Active, Inactive or anything else.
